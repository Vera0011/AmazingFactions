# AmazingFactions
This plugin allows the users to create, manage and remove factions. It also includes all the necessary features to perform an inmersing experience.

## What is a faction?
A faction (also knows as clan) is a group that can be formed by multiple users, to compete with others, claim territories and have expeditions.

## Why AmazingFactions is amazing?
Multiple factions plugins have been created, but not like this one. This plugin creates an inmersive environemt for users, and also allows the managers to have a hands-free experience without problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin is still in development and we recommend to not use it in a production environment
